						Maybe this should be titled analytical storytelling with data, because that's really what we're doing.
						<br><br>
						So how do you tell a story?
						<br><br>
						To answer that I’m going to start by telling you a story........this story is about a young woman who walks into a bar......this happened in berlin in the early 1920’s........this young Russian woman........who was doing her phd at the time......in what was at this time a new field called psychology.........and by the end of this story she’ll have made an observation that will change how we understand storytelling.......to this day.

						This is pretty cool....... because stories make us pay attention.
						<br><br>
						Data analysis isn't really about data and charts. It's about finding & telling a story.
						<br><br>
						When communicating effectively with data…....it's vital that you have a coherant message.......Stories are very powerful tool for delivering and communicating this message.......we have been using stories for 1000's of years to pass knowledge down from generation to generation.
						<br><br>
						Sometimes.....its just difficult to explain concepts without visually representing what were trying to communicate. What might take several page of text can be easly represented in a single image.
						<br><br>
						After most presentation....about 63% of attendees remember storeies, while only 5% remembered statistics.

							On the left hand side.....you’ve light refracting off the stimulus......we don’t really see with our eyes....because most of what we think we’re seeing actually happens in our brains.......in the brain there’s a few types of memory that are important to consider when designing for visual communications...we’ll talk about one of them today...iconic memory.
							<br><br>
							This is super short term…..shorter that short...information stays there for fractions of a second….before it gets forwarded onto our short term memory…..
							<br><br> 
							The nice thing about our iconic memory is that its tunes to a few preattentive attributes…

							Most people will take a long line to represent a greater number than a short line….its one of the reason that bar charts are intuitive for use to read…...but we don’t think of hue for example….in the same way….if I ask you which is greater ...red or blue….its not really a meaningful question…..this is important because it tells us which attributes should be use to code quantitative information and which should be used as categorical differentiators…

							When looking at visualiations your eye's are always drawn to certain area's. When develoing visualations you can test where your users eyes will focus by looking way.....then look back....where ever your eyes land first.....is probably where your audience eyes will also land.

							Exploratory: start with a question.......you dig through the data, to uncover what’s interesting and ask questions like......
							<br><br>
							what can I learn about this data?...that someone else might care about….once you identify this….then we move into explanatory space…...where you have something specific that you want to communicate to somebody specific….

							As you sift through all this data, it's important to focus on meaningful content as you're exploring.
							<br><br>
							Then design your visualization

							Always try and eliminate as much clutter as possible....keep it simple

							It depicts Napoleon advancement durning the winter of 1812, from France on the left hand side over to Russian and back again. The size of the yellow represents 420,000 troops that left France and by the time his army had reached Moscow it was reduced to about 100,000 (becuse of the harshness of the conditions).

							So how do we craft a good narrative?
							<br><br>
							We need a plot, a twist and an ending
							<br><br>
							In the plot: we define 'What context is essential'?
							<br><br>
							The twist: makes us focus on what's interesting about the data and what it shows?
							<br><br>
							and the ending is our call to action, we should always want our audience to do something, like exploring the visualization more on their own
							<br><br>
							and we should make this as clear as possible.

							Here we're comparing the before and after satistics from the anwer to a question given to a bunch of students about "How they feel about doing science?"
							<br><br>
							It's hard to compare across two pies..
							<br><br>
							But if I talk the audience through the narrative.....you can see that before the program.....40% felt ok about science.........but after this number was reduced to 14%.....most of the movement was in the positive direction…...blue section....students we're more 'Excited' about science after the program which was up by 19%
							<br><br>
							Notice with a strong narrative….I can actually get away with a crummy visual….the alternative isn’t true…..best data vis with no story can be useless.
							<br><br>
							Visualizations underscore the narrative.....and true nirvana is when you’ve both…..

							If I change this to a bar chart and also have a clear call to action....."lets keep offering this program"
							<br><br>
							We need to be thoughtful, with our use of data.......use it strategically and intentionally with the use of color…..
							<br><br>
							Next we'll look at a visualization that could have easily been done with a scatter plot, but instead the author creatively built this visualization depicting the relationship between Driver safty and miles driven.

							The Vertical axis...which is number of car fatalities........and the horizontal axis is the number of miles driven......and there’s a data point for each year...
							<br><br>
							Annotation tell you about specific moments.....
							<br><br>
							You have a loop…..something that you cannot see on a scatter plot…...remember the horizontal axis isn’t time….time is along the line….
							<br><br> 
							So as miles drop….fatalities also drop…
							<br><br>
							You turn...whats just numbers into something that people will want to explore….

							Sean carter at New York Times once said you must design your visualization for both bart simpson and lisa simpson.
							<br><br>
							There are many paths that can be taken when exploring data......we need to find the most compelling path and highlight it to our audience.
							<br><br>
							We will need to provide additional information to help our audience understand the data.
							<br><br>
							When building the narrative structure keep the user experience in mind.....ask your self?...how do we walk our audience into our understanding….
							<br><br>
							We think of this in UI design...but need to think of it visually.
							<br><br>
							Its rare that people will go straight to exploration….before first getting a story…….so think about your audience…
							<br><br>
							Provide insight into something that they normally wouldn’t be able to see…..we need to engage the audience
							<br><br>
							If its not doing one of these two things….its probably just an attractive visualization and it isn’t doing what’s intended
							<br><br>
							Turning data into a story, that's the magic
							<br><br>
							We need look at the data from different perspectives........different slices reveals different information…
							<br><br>
							Next I'm going to quickly walk you through some of my favorite data visualizations.
