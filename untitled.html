							IF we know the change we want our audience to experience through our visualization, then we know whic storyline to choose.
							<br><br>
							If I simply want to change your information, I want to give you new facts.....I'm going to give you a report
							<br><br>
							If I want to change your knowledge and your ability......I'm going to give you an explanation.
							<br><br>
							If I want you to change your actions....we are moving this way to day, but we need to start moving that way....i'm going to give you a pitch
							<br><br>
							If we're going to change our beliefs....we belief this to be true, but I want you to believe that to be true...the only way that
							I can do that is to give you a drama.
							<br><br>
							Today were going to focus on the drama.....because this is the big one, because it changes beliefs.....its got the most power ever.
							<br><br>
							You should never ever give a report.....you should use another story line....and fit it around your report, because that's the 
							storyline that people will find compelling.

							The patron saint of pesenters...

							Joseph John Campbell was an American mythologist, writer, and lecturer, best known for his work in comparative mythology 
							<br><br>
							Has anyone heard of Joseph Campbell?
							<br><br>
							Travelled the world…..he was fascinatedby all the mythms in the world....he learnt to speak seven different languages.....and he would get to know the great myths from each one of the cultures.......he wrote a book "hero of 1000 faces".....its he's summary of the commonality he found in all these great world myths.... gathering all the myth’s of the world...1920’s-80’s…..and seen a pattern in all these myths….common threads…..

						</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							And one of the pieces that was in this book, is something that became know as "the hero's journey"
							<br><br>
							Joseph John Campbell introduced this back in the 1950's it didn't really go anywhere....very few academics really paid attention to it and found it interesting
							<br><br>
							but since then, for reasons tha we'll explore....this has become a really common thread for how we come up with an interesting story.
							<br><br>
							This is joseph Campbell's own drawing of the circle....
							<br><br>
							We start at point X....where a hero (just a common person), crosses from the regular world which is above the line into strange supernatural world (which is everything below this line)
							<br><br>
							In that supernatural and strange world...at point Y....that hero encounters fabolous forces....and the hero has to fight an incredible battle.....to destroy those forces...in that strange world
							<br><br>
							Then having learnt the lessons from having fought that battle, the hero then at point Z, comes back into the regular world....but now a very changed person.....because of the battles that person had to fight in the strange world....when he comes back......he has this greater knowledge.
							<br><br>
							Whatever doesn't kill us makes us stronger
							<br><br>
							So....lets check and see is joseph campbell was right!......the way to check if this story / drama actually has power for us....is to look at what's popular.......is to look at the three most successful movie franchises of all time around the world......is there something that resinates with people in general about this story......lets see if it carries through the three most popular stories of all time.
